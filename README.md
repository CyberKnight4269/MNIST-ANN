<h1 align='center'>MNIST-ANN</h1>

A simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. Implemented in **TensorFlow Keras** on **Google Colab**.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Preprocessed MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images)  
✅ Built a feedforward neural network using Keras  
✅ Trained with sparse categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer  
✅ Achieved high accuracy of 97.79% on test data  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:  
   https://colab.research.google.com/github/CyberKnight4269/MNIST-ANN/blob/main/MNIST_using_ANN.ipynb
2. Add the train and test datasets. Download here(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)
3. Change the path of the datasets accordingly.
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
